A small collection of OpenClaw AgentSkills maintained by @Deltaidiots.

## Skills

- `strava` — fetch Strava activities via OAuth (refresh token), summarize recent training, and provide a clean base for calendar workflows.

## Notes

- Skills are designed to be auditable: no bundled secrets, no hidden downloads.
- Prefer storing secrets in `chmod 600` env files and injecting at runtime.
